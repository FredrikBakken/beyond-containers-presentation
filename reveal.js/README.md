Notes:

Unikernels for Fast and Secure Computing
- Security and low-level aspects
- OS, unikernels, library OS, software, re-configurability
- Differences between software and hardware?
  - Flexibility: Security flaws, machine code, increased complexity
  - Easy to develop, debug, deploy, test
  - [Re]-usability (!!)
    - Libraries
      - Applications: Apps & deamons
      - Libraries: Frameworks, languages, dependencies, modules, protocols, game engines, 
    - Open-source was not big 10-20 years ago
      - Millions of projects/pieces of code to pick and use as "you want"

OPERATING SYSTEMS
- Operating system, does it seem more like an application or library?
- 

OPERATING SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
- (kernel/user context switching)
- What are the most important advantages of having a operating system?
